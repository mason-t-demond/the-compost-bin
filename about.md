Hello! My name is Mason Mason and I am a currently a senior at Hendrix College. I am currently majoring in Computer Science and this class will mark HTML as the 7th programming language I have learned so far. My goal for this semester is to make it onto the Dean's List for the first time since I've been here, as I've always come up just short.

I am from Conway, Arkansas, so I'm not too far from home. I also plan to stay here for at least a couple of years after college (provided a better opportunity doesn't come around). My goal would be to work in some area that uses Computer Science for data analysis, however, I've also been interested in IT jobs recently.
