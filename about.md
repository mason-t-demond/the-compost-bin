# About Me
Hello, my name is Tyrone Demond Mason, but I prefer to go by Mason. I am a senior at Hendrix College in Conway, Arkansas, where I have lived since 2015.

# Project Background
To maximize my time for the summer, I chose to help one of my professors, Dr. Mark Goadrich, with a project that interested me. It is known as RECYCLEd CardStock, and is an exciting method of simulating card games between AI players and finding what variants of games provide more interesting and dramatic outcomes.

# Project Goals
Over the next few weeks, I plan to assist Dr. Goadrich in the following ways:
- [ ] Rewriting the engine's code in order to increase simulation speed.
- [ ] Create a program that will translate ReCYCLe game files into C# files.
